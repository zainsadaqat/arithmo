          Cookies are small text files that websites place on the computers and
          mobile devices of people who visit those websites.

          These text files allow a website to remember your device and how you
          interacted with the website, which is useful for a number of different
          purposes.

          For example, cookies can be used to remember username and password
          information so that you donâ€™t have to re-enter all of your login
          information every time you visit a site you frequently log in to.

          video streaming or volume settings you have selected while using the
